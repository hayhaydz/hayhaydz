I'm a Frontend Developer creating websites on the interwebs, currently focussed on building Shopify storefronts.

In my spare time I enjoy photography, hiking, reading, piano and watching anime, some of my favourites include Cowboy Bebop, HxH. Naruto, Bleach, Steins;Gate and Dr. Stone.

You can send me an [email](mailto:haydon.curteis-lateo@outlook.com), look at my photography on ([unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@hayhaydz)/[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/199728645@N02/)), connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayhaydz/) (or the cooler LinkedIn [read.cv](https://read.cv/haydon)), or just have a browse through some of my work here on GitHub!
