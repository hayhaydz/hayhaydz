Hey, I'm Haydon.

I'm a web developer in my third year studying Creative Computing at Bath Spa University.

In my spare time I enjoy anything from photography to watching Attack on Titan, I'm always up for new oppurtunities and exciting challenges.

You can send me an [email](mailto:haydon.curteis-lateo@outlook.com), look at my photography on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@hayhaydz), connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayhaydz/), or just have a browse through some of my work here on GitHub!
